PI4---Network-Issue
The Raspberry Pi seems to loose it's Network Connectivity for some reason. This script helped me to keep the Pi connected to the network.

BASH Scripting

Sometimes the Raspberry Pi 4 with a USB 3.0 SSD connected to it loses it's IP                          
As such it was not reachable anymore. Luckily his scripts helps                                        
Since implementation no issues again                                                                   
                                                                                                        
usage:    Download the script and save it in a directory                                               
           sudo chmod +x check_network.sh                                                               
                                                                                                        
           sudo nano /etc/crontab
